# Hyde
Process selected data from the HYDE model and store in easy to use file formats.

## What is Hyde?
HYDE presents (gridded) time series of population and land use for the last 12,000 years ! It also presents various other indicators such as GDP, value added, livestock, agricultural areas and yields, private consumption, greenhouse gas emissions and industrial production data, but only for the last century.

## Why this repo?
Hyde is available for download as zipped ascii files from an FTP server. For easy analysis, other file formats are preferred. This repository contains a few scripts to convert the files to geotiffs on Amazon S3 and ImageCollections on Google Earthengine.
